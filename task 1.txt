*** Set up Git repository on storage server

1. login to the storage server:
"ssh natasha@ststor01"
password: "Bl@kW"

2. update:
"sudo yum update -y"

3. Install git:
"sudo yum install git -y"

4. Create bare git in /opt/demo.git
"sudo cd /opt/ && git init --bare demo.git"



** Issues Encountered
- did not login to the storage server wth the right credentials
- did not use sudo, so permssion was denied to create the git bare


** When to Use a Bare Repository?

Use a bare repository if you're:


- Setting up a centralized Git server (not GitHub).
- Hosting a repository internally for sharing without a Git hosting 
service.
Acting as a backup or synchronization point.

For GitHub, bare repositories are already managed for you, so it's 
easier to rely on cloning instead.
