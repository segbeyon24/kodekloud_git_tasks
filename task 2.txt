*** Clone Git repository on storage server

1. login to the storage server:
"ssh natasha@ststor01"
password: "Bl@kW"

2. cd to the destination directory
"cd [dest._dir]"

3. clone git repo:
"sudo git clone /opt/demo.git"
	- this creates a "blog" folder, containing only .git folder



** Issues Encountered
- when I cloned the git at home dir, without doing a cd to the
  destination folder, it cloned the .git folder, omitting the "blog"
  folder.
